# 🌐 Limit Break Token - #LIMIT

> "Scarcity is the identity. Not everyone is meant to break limits."

---

### 🔸 Introduction

In a space saturated with noise, hype, and short-term gains, Limit Break Token (#LIMIT) emerges with a radically different identity — not just as a digital asset, but as a symbol of mindset, merit, and long-term purpose.

This isn't a token created to go viral overnight.  
It's crafted to be earned, held, and understood — by only the few who truly break their limits.

With a total supply capped and controlled, a silent pre-phase buildup, and a long-term burn mechanism, this project is structured around scarcity, prestige, and mystery.

We don't shout.  
We don't promise.  
We build silently.  
And those who understand, already know.

### 🔸 What is #LIMIT?

- A token with a purpose beyond speculation  
- A badge for those who operate with vision  
- A mark of identity for the rare 1% — the Limit Breakers

### 🔸 Why It Matters

Most projects seek users.  
This project seeks believers.  
Not everyone will hold #LIMIT. That’s the point.

Every element — from token control to supply burn — is designed with the principle:

> "If everyone can have it, it has no value."

### 🔸 Road Ahead (Preview)

We don't show the full roadmap.  
Because Limit Breakers don't follow steps — they create them.

But here’s what we can tell you:

- Silent buildup until **3 August 2026**
- First symbolic token burn on **3 August 2027** (every 5 years)
- Phase-wise rollout of point system, utility layer, and ecosystem modules
