  <h1>🌐 Limit Break Token - #LIMIT</h1>
  <p class="quote">"Scarcity is the identity. Not everyone is meant to break limits."</p>

  <h2>🔸 Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    In a space saturated with noise, hype, and short-term gains, Limit Break Token (#LIMIT) emerges with a radically different identity — not just as a digital asset, but as a symbol of mindset, merit, and long-term purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    This isn't a token created to go viral overnight.<br>
    It's crafted to be earned, held, and understood — by only the few who truly break their limits.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a total supply capped and controlled, a silent pre-phase buildup, and a long-term burn mechanism, this project is structured around scarcity, prestige, and mystery.
  </p>
  <p>We don't shout. We don't promise. We build silently. And those who understand, already know.</p>

  <h2>🔸 What is #LIMIT?</h2>
  <p>
    A token with a purpose beyond speculation.<br>
    A badge for those who operate with vision.<br>
    A mark of identity for the rare 1% — the Limit Breakers.
  </p>

  <h2>🔸 Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Most projects seek users. This project seeks believers. Not everyone will hold #LIMIT. That’s the point.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every element — from token control to supply burn — is designed with the principle:<br>
    <em>"If everyone can have it, it has no value."</em>
  </p>

  <h2>🔸 Road Ahead (Preview)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Silent buildup until 3 August 2026</li>
    <li>First symbolic token burn on 3 August 2027 (every 5 years)</li>
    <li>Phase-wise rollout of point system, utility layer, and ecosystem modules</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    LIMIT is not a trend. It’s a test. <br/>
    Welcome to a token that won't chase you — you’ll have to find it, understand it, and earn your way in.
